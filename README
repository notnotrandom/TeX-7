    TeX-7 is a toned-down fork of Elias Toivanen's TeX-9
    (https://github.com/vim-scripts/TeX-9) vim plugin for LaTeX writing. I like
    TeX-9 a lot but, even though it is a rather minimalist plugin, it still has
    some features I think are too much.

    First and foremost, compiling. LaTeX build process is *not* trivial, and
    vim is not an IDE. So I removed that part. I also don't think this plugin
    should provide skeletons, so that's gone too. And SyncTeX configuration
    heavily depends on the viewer used, so maybe a minimalist plugin is not the
    best place... I tweaked some of the default mappings to my liking (although
    the plugin retains TeX-9's ease of customization.)

    I few years ago I patched TeX-9 to allow omni completion for \includeonly
    statements, but that never got included in the main source. Well, it is
    here now. Another feature is that in the making is allowing that hitting
    `gd` over a \ref, takes you to the corresponding \label, even when they are
    on different files.

    Otherwise, this plugin is mostly like its predecessor.
